# Plugins

The Pyramids Parser attempts to be language-agnostic. The tokenizer and
parser model determine a parser instance's supported language. Models and
tokenizers are provided by separately installed plugins.


# TODO
* Explain how to find and install plugins.
* Document the expected interfaces for the tokenizer and model loader 
  plugins.
* Explain how to create and package a model plugin.
