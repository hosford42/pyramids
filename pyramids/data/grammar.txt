# Description:
#
#   This file defines the default build rule set for competitive_parser.py.
#   Rules consist of a category and a list of structures it can consist of.
#
#   An asterisk (*) in a structural component indicates the head of the
#   structure. An asterisk must appear exactly once in each sequence
#   structure, and must be placed immediately in front of the indicated
#   category with no intervening white space.
#
#   A pipe (|) indicates that multiple categories can be used in the same
#   structure. Note that * applies to all categories joined together with
#   pipes. They can only be used at the beginning of the entire group, not
#   the individual elements.
#
#   A category consisting of a single underscore (_) by itself is treated as
#   a wildcard which can match any category.
#
#   TODO: Add an explanation & example for category properties & inheritance.
#
#   Links can be inserted between structural components to indicate how
#   they should be connected to the head of the structure when it is
#   converted to a semantic net subgraph. Anything containing a <
#   or a > is considered to be a link name, not a structural component.
#   The direction of the symbol indicates which node is the source and
#   which is the sink. Links connect the head with the nearest structural
#   component on the opposite side. Multiple links can connect the same
#   component to the head.
#
#   Example:
#           result: component1|component2 <LINK component3 *component1|component4
#       This rule will look for any parse tree with a category of component1 or
#       component2, followed by a parse tree with a category of component3, and
#       finally followed a parse tree with a category of component1 or
#       component4. The third parse tree will be the head of the new parse
#       tree. When the language graph is constructed, the node corresponding to
#       the first parse tree, will be linked to the node corresponding to the
#       third (head) parse tree via a link of type LINK, with the source being
#       the head and the sink being the first parse tree's node. The head's
#       node will then be used to correspond to the parse tree as a whole.

# TODO: Names as noun phrase heads.
#         Examples:
#           "good old Bob"
#           "Joseph of Bethlehem"
#           "the same Janet that he dated"

# TODO: The command, "Do not." is broken now, since I switched over to using not
#       as purely a prefix "conjunction". Also, it might be good to be able to
#       handle the somewhat archaic forms used by Yoda in his classic quote:
#       "Try not. Do, or do not. There is no try."

# TODO: Transitive clauses (having both object & target) should be barred from
#       restrictions in object and target phrases. They produce complex ambiguities,
#       and people avoid them in their language.
#         Examples:
#           "I bought the dog I gave some food a collar."
#               would be said "I bought the dog I gave some food to a collar."
#               or "I bought a collar for the dog that I gave some food."
#           "I took a friend I gave some money."
#               would be said "I took a friend I gave some money to."
#               or "I took a friend that I gave some money."

# TODO: Adjectival phrases that follow pronouns that are made by merging determiners
#       with other words.
#         Examples:
#           "Something big came through here."
#           "Was there anyone good looking?"
#           "Everyone finished go ahead and put your tests here."
#           "Everything smelly goes in the bag."

# TODO: Pronouns that also act as determiners (or vice versa, depending on how you
#       look at it) need their own word class. Maybe pronouns and determiners
#       should all be combined into the same category and distinguished via properties?
#       Also, explore whether numbers and determinerish words like "other" can also
#       be lumped in.

# TODO: Allow the grammar to specify movable components. These are subtrees which
#       may be omitted from branch rules and added in at a higher level in the
#       parse. The most common uses are for restrictions and questions. Rules
#       based on this should have properties automatically added based on the
#       link type being omitted. For example, for a restriction in which the
#       head noun acts as the object of the subordinated predicate, we would
#       have the OBJECT link of the predicate (and the link's sink) omitted and
#       a "takes_object" property added to the predicate. Then when the
#       restriction is combined with the head noun, a link of type OBJECT_OF
#       would be generated to connect the head noun to the predicate with the
#       missing object. In this way we preserve the property that links always
#       traverse from the head to the subordinated trees, but still represent
#       the relationship between the phrases correctly. A link of type *_OF
#       is used to represent a reversed link for the cognitive engine.

# TODO: Handle stuff like "each other", "the poor", etc. where there is a determiner
#       and adjective but no noun, and the assumed noun is "person" or "people".

# TODO: Create a new conjunction rule type and a separate file with its own syntax
#       for them. Conjunction rules should be generated by category and property, so
#       that terms which agree can be grouped together. Conjunctive phrases should
#       promote all properties shared by every case/exception unless specifically
#       blocked.
#           Example definition for conjunctions of the category "subject":
#               *    subject(first): *subject(first) subject # Indicates that to form a first-person subject as a conjunctive phrase containing other subjects, there must be a first-person subject, and there may be other subjects with other personage
#               *    subject(second): *subject(second) subject(third) # Indicates that to form a second-person subject as a conjunctive phrase containing other subjects, there must be a second-person subject, and there may be third-person subjects
#               and+ subject(plural): subject # Indicates that to form a plural subject with the "and" conjunction, there must be more than one subject
#               not  subject(plural): *subject(plural) # Indicates that to form a plural subject with the "not" conjunction, there must be a plural subject

# TODO: Combine QUALITY and ASSOCIATE link types into the single common link type
#       QUALIFIER. This makes more sense, since both serve to answer questions of the
#       form "What kind of <noun>?" with statements of the form "<quality> <noun>"
#       or "<associate> <noun>", and their grammar rules are easily confused as
#       to which is appropriate to use. Add a rule to convert unconjugated noun
#       phrases into adjectives and only use adjectives to modify nouns via QUALIFIER
#       links.

# TODO: Targeted abilities. These are sentences where the main verb acts as a
#       modal for an ability that has a different subject.
#           Examples:
#               "Let me have some."
#               "She made him go home."

# TODO: The phrase "some more".

# TODO: Replace the OBJECT/TARGET dichotomy with ACCESSORY/TARGET.
#       ACCESSORY should indicate a third party to the transaction,
#       the thing being conveyed, transferred, or used, while TARGET
#       should indicate the recipient of the transaction. Either one
#       is optional.
#           Examples:
#               "He paid me some money."
#                   TARGET: me
#                   ACCESSORY: money
#                   Can be shortened to "He paid me." or "He paid some money." or even "He paid."
#               "She threw him the ball."
#                   TARGET: him
#                   ACCESSORY: ball
#                   Can be shortened to "She threw the ball." or "She threw." but not "She threw him."
#                   This is due only to the verb being used, not a general rule.

# TODO: Determiner questions.
#       Examples:
#           "Which apple fell?"
#           "You took which book?"
#           "You gave which person the money?"
#           "What level is it?"
#       NOTE: I've done most of this, but I still need to finish with the property inheritance for "question" moving up through the ranks from noun_phrase.

# TODO: Kind-words such as "kind", "sort", "class", "subclass", "type", "subtype", "set", "subset", etc. need special treatment.
#       Example phrases where they act differently from standard nouns:
#           "What kind of apple is that?"
#           "Which type of sentence was that?"

# TODO: Phrases of the form "anything <adjective_phrase>" or "[any] <noun> that <adjective_phrase>".
#           Examples:
#               "Did you find anything odd?"
#               "Anything that big will need to be checked."
#               "Anybody that stupid deserves it!"
#               "We'll just have to truncate any names that long." (Note the variant, "any names longer than that")
#               "Anything metal has to go in the bin."
#               "Books that thin shouldn't be hardbacked."

# TODO: Pronomial quantifier phrases of the form "<quantifying pronoun> of <noun phrase>".
#       Then get rid of "one" and other quantifying pronouns which are currently misclassified as nouns as a kludge.
#           Examples:
#               "None of them were right."
#               "One of the apples had a worm."
#               "It only happens some of the time.
#               "Each one of them is a totally new concept."
#               "Each of them has a different plan."
#               "All [of] the quantities are equal."

# TODO: Questions of the form "What <prepositional phrase>?"
#           Examples:
#               "What if we don't?"
#               "What about the other one?"
#               "What in the world?"

# TODO: How-come questions.
#           Examples:
#               "How come it does that?"

# TODO: Specially-formed quick answer questions.
#           Examples:
#               "What for?"
#               "Why?"
#               "Why not?"
#               "How come?"
#               "Where?"
#               "When?"
#               "What?"

# TODO: Swearing interjections.
#           Example:
#               "Where the hell have you been!?"
#               "It damn well better be!"

# TODO: Add conjunctions for other categories?
# TODO: Figure out a way to eliminate the redundancies here.

# TODO: Conjunctive phrases containing other conjunctive phrases end up marked with the 
#       conjunctions of the contained conjunctive phrases as well as their own.
#       For example, "you and him or her" will end up with the top level node
#       marked as both "and" and "or" regardless of how it is parsed. We need the
#       conjunction to be any-promoted like it is now, but we need it to only be for
#       the outermost conjunction. This means splitting out the rules for each
#       conjunction and adding a negative property for the other conjunctions.
