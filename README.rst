Pyramids gets its name from the way it constructs parse trees, working
upwards from the leaves towards the root, building up layers of
progressively smaller size but greater scope. It is a rule-based natural
language parser which builds multiple competing parses for a sentence from
the bottom up using principles of dynamic programming. The parses are then
scored for quality and presented in order of descending rank. The parser is
also capable of accepting feedback as to which parses are or are not acceptable,
adaptively adjusting its scoring measures to improve future parse quality and
ranking. Parses are returned as trees but can also be used to generate graphs
representing the semantic relationships between words. The syntactic rules of
the parser can also be run in reverse to generate sentences from semantic graphs
resembling those it produces.
